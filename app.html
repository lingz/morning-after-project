      <p>
        The best strategy for safer sex is to always use a condom. Make sure that you use correctly sized condoms as this can reduce the chance of breakage. 
        They have been proven to be highly effective at both preventing <span class="all-caps">STI</span>s including <span class="all-caps">HIV</span>, as well as unplanned pregnancies.

                  <p>
                    Here are three things to keep in mind as you consider your next steps.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Don't self diagnose
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Self diagnosis is not wise as sexually transmitted diseases can have different symptoms for different people, and similar symptoms to other unrelated health problems. It is much better to get a diagnosis from a trained health professional - they can also help you access treatment. 
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Tell your partner
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    It is important to inform your partners as soon as you test positive for STD so that they can also get tested, get treatment and prevent the spread of the condition. If you would like to do this anonymously, you can used this <a href="http://www.stdcheck.com/anonymous-notification.php">anonymous <span class="all-caps">STI</span> notification app</a>.

                    You may be at risk of the following conditions:

                          Having unprotected vaginal sex can lead to pregnancy. This is true at every point within a woman's menstrual cycle and even when the male partner does not ejaculate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Because of this, women can get pregnant when they are not prepared for the immense responsibility of having a baby. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          To prevent pregnancy, even when you have had unprotected sex, you can take the morning-after pill up to 72 hours after intercourse. This pill is found over the counter in some places or you may need a prescription from a doctor.
                        </p>

                          If you think you are at risk of <span class="all-caps">HIV</span>, you can start a Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) course within 48 hours of exposure which will significantly reduce your chances of contracting <span class="all-caps">HIV</span>.

                        <p>
                          If you frequently engage in risky sexual behavior, consult with a doctor about starting a Pre Exposure Prophylaxis (PREP) prescription. This is a daily pill which will significantly reduce the risk of you contracting <span class="all-caps">HIV</span> in the future. However, this should never be considered a substitute for condoms.

Therefore if you think you may be at risk of contracting <span class="all-caps">HIV</span>, consult a doctor immediately.

            Ihadunsafesex.com was started in 2014. We created this web application because we wanted to provide a way for people, in a time of crisis, to cut through the myriad of confusing, convoluted and contradictory information on the internet about sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. We want to provide terrified people with all the information they need to access appropriate health services without judgement or stigma. 
          </p>
